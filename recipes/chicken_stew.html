    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 tbsp </strong> olive oil</li>
        <li><strong>1 bunch</strong> spring onions, sliced, white and green parts separated</li>
        <li><strong>1 small swede (350g)</strong> peeled and chopped into small pieces</li>
        <li><strong>400g</strong> potatoes, peeled and chopped into small pieces</li>
        <li><strong>8</strong> skinless boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li><strong>1 tbsp</strong> Dijon mustard</li>
        <li><strong>500ml</strong> chicken stock</li>
        <li><strong>200g</strong> Savoy cabbage or spring cabbage, sliced</li>
        <li><strong>2 tsp </strong> cornflour (optional)</li>
        <li>crusty bread or cheese scones, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Add the white spring onion slices and fry for 1 min to soften. Tip in the swede and potatoes and cook for 2-3 mins more, then add the chicken, mustard and stock. Cover and cook for 35 mins, or until the vegetables are tender and the chicken cooked through.</li>
        <li>Add the cabbage and simmer for another 5 mins. If the stew looks too thin, mix the cornflour with 1 tbsp cold water and pour a couple of teaspoonfuls into the pan; let the stew bubble and thicken, then check again. If it's still too thin, add a little more of the cornflour mix and let the stew bubble and thicken some more. </li>
        <li>Season to taste, then spoon the stew into deep bowls. Scatter over the green spring onion slices and serve with crusty bread or warm cheese scones, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
