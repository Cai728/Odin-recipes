    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The piña colada is a blended or iced cocktail that originated in Puerto Rico.
        It's usually made with white rum, cream of coconut, and pineapple juice. 
        In this easy nonalcoholic recipe, just nix the rum and use coconut milk instead of the cream.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the recipe uses frozen pineapple chunks, you really don't need to add as much ice. 
        Start with 1/4 cup and add more if you want a frostier drink. 
        Blend it up until the consistency is smooth and creamy
    </p>
    <p>
        The traditional piña colada is garnished with either a pineapple wedge, 
        a maraschino cherry, or both. Feel free to garnish with what you like, 
        including a little paper umbrella.
