    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Tandoori chicken is a popular Indian dish filled with flavor from spices like coriander, cumin, ginger, etc. 
        Traditionally, tandoori chicken is cooked in a clay oven called a tandoor. 
        Since many of us do not have a tandoor, I've offered two alternative cooking methods:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinating and grilling</li>
        <li>Adding everything to a slow cooker for shredded chicken</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Traditional tandoori chicken recipes usually include yogurt and garlic. These ingredients are healthy and delicious options for many people. 
        However, for those of us with irritable bowel syndrome, 
        these ingredients contain FODMAPs that can contribute to our symptoms
    </p>
    <p>
        For this inspired recipe, I've swapped out garlic for lower FODMAP garlic-infused oil. 
        I've also used low FODMAP amounts of canned coconut milk instead of traditional yogurt.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Coconut milk - ½ cup</strong> (I like Native Forest Simple or Aroy-D) </li>
        <li><strong>Garlic-infused oil</strong> - 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li><strong>Ground paprika</strong> - 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong> - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li><strong>Ground coriander</strong> - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li><strong>Ground cumin</strong> - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li><strong>Ground ginger</strong> - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li><strong>Ground turmeric</strong> - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li><strong>Optional: Cayenne pepper</strong> - ¼ teaspoon</li>
        <li><strong>Boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts</strong> - 1 to 1.25 pounds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps for Marinated and Grilled Chicken:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together coconut milk, oil, paprika, salt, coriander, cumin, ginger, turmeric, and optional cayenne pepper in a medium bowl (with a lid).</li>
        <li>Add chicken and stir until the chicken is well-coated with marinade. Marinate for at least 1 hour, but ideally 8 hours.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat grill or oven broiler. Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard any remaining marinade. Grill (or broil) the chicken until cooked. Chicken is fully cooked when a food thermometer inserted into the thickest part reads 165°F.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong> chicken warm.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Steps for Slow Cooker (Shredded Chicken)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place coconut milk, oil, paprika, coriander, cumin, ginger, turmeric, and optional cayenne in a slow cooker. Whisk to mix.</li>
        <li>Add chicken. Stir until chicken is evenly coated with sauce. Cook on low for 4-6 hours or until the chicken easily shreds.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, use two forks to shred chicken into the remaining liquid. Add seasoning to taste. <em>I use less salt for this method, about ½ teaspoon.</em></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Serve this with:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cooked basmati rice</strong> (or other type of rice)</li>
        <li><strong>Cucumber slices</strong> - a FODMAP-free veggie</li>
        <li><strong>Cherry tomatoes</strong> - 5 cherry tomatoes or 75 grams is low FODMAP</li>
        
    </ul>
